# Analyze_CyTOF_Using_Seurat
Cytometry by time-of-flight(CyTOF) data is very useful in studying the presence/absence of antigens/surface markers at single cell level. There are multiple tools to analyze CyTOF data but here I am presenting a tutorial of how one can quickly use Seurat (R package for scRNA-Seq analysis) for analyzing CyTOF data and understand the cellular and phenotypic diversity
